# Chapter 3: Bridging Python Agents to ROS Control with rclpy

## Introduction

This chapter covers the integration of Python-based AI agents with ROS 2 control systems using rclpy, the Python client library for ROS 2. You'll learn how to create a bridge between Python applications and ROS 2 systems, enabling AI agents to interact with robotic hardware through ROS 2 communication patterns.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the architecture and capabilities of rclpy
- Create ROS 2 nodes using Python with rclpy
- Implement publishing, subscribing, and service calls via rclpy
- Build a complete Python agent that controls a simulated robot action
- Integrate AI/ML components with ROS 2 systems

## Table of Contents

- [rclpy Architecture](./rclpy-architecture.md)
- [Writing Nodes in Python](./python-nodes.md)
- [rclpy Operations: Publishing, Subscribing, Services](./rclpy-operations.md)
- [Python Agent Example](./python-agent-example.md)
- [Validation and Testing](./validation.md)

This chapter provides the essential knowledge needed to connect Python-based AI agents with ROS 2 robotic systems. Understanding rclpy is crucial for the Physical AI course focus, connecting AI/ML agents with robotic systems through ROS 2 middleware.
