# Deployment Strategies and Considerations

## Simulation-to-Reality Transfer

Deploying perception-to-action systems from simulation to reality requires careful consideration:

**Domain Gap Management**: Addressing differences between simulated and real environments.

**Performance Validation**: Ensuring that integrated systems perform adequately in real-world conditions.

**Safety Verification**: Confirming that integrated systems operate safely in physical environments.

**Calibration Requirements**: Adjusting system parameters for real-world sensor and actuator characteristics.

## Deployment Architectures

**Edge Deployment**: Running perception and action systems on robot-embedded hardware.

**Cloud Integration**: Offloading computationally intensive tasks to cloud resources.

**Hybrid Approaches**: Combining edge and cloud processing for optimal performance and capability.

**Federated Systems**: Distributing processing across multiple computing nodes for complex applications.

## Educational Deployment Models

**Laboratory Integration**: Deploying systems in controlled laboratory environments for student projects.

**Remote Access**: Providing remote access to deployed systems for distance learning.

**Graduated Complexity**: Starting with simple deployments and increasing complexity as students advance.

**Collaborative Projects**: Multiple students working on different aspects of integrated systems.
