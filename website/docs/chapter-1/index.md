# Chapter 1: Foundations of ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System

In this chapter, you'll learn about the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 as a robotic nervous system. We'll explore what ROS 2 is, why it exists, and how it serves as middleware for robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Explain what ROS 2 is and its role in robotics
- Understand DDS (Data Distribution Service) and middleware concepts
- Describe how distributed communication works in ROS 2
- Articulate why ROS 2 serves as a "robotic nervous system"

## Table of Contents

- [What is ROS 2?](./concepts.md)
- [DDS and Middleware Concepts](./middleware.md)
- [Distributed Communication Overview](./distributed.md)
- [Validation](./validation.md)

This chapter provides the foundational knowledge required before diving into practical implementation. Without understanding these core concepts, you cannot effectively use ROS 2 for robotic applications.
