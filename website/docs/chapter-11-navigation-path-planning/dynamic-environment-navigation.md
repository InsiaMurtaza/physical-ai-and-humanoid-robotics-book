# Dynamic Environment Navigation

## Challenges in Dynamic Environments

Navigation in environments with moving obstacles and changing conditions presents unique challenges:

**Predictive Modeling**: Understanding and predicting the motion of dynamic obstacles.

**Reactive Planning**: Ability to quickly replan trajectories when new obstacles appear.

**Uncertainty Management**: Handling uncertainty in both robot state and environment state.

**Safety Guarantees**: Ensuring safe navigation despite dynamic environment uncertainties.

## Isaac's Dynamic Navigation Capabilities
