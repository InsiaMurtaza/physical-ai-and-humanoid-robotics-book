# Introduction

Welcome to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course", a comprehensive guide to embodied intelligence in physical environments. This course bridges the gap between digital AI systems and their physical manifestations, providing you with the knowledge and skills needed to develop intelligent robots that interact with the real world.

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
2. Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
3. Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
4. Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
5. Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
6. Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics
