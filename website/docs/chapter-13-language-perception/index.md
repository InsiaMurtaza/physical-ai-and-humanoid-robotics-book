# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems represent the convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and robotics, enabling integrated perception, language understanding, cognitive planning, and physical execution. This module provides education administrators with analytical understanding of VLA systems' capabilities for robotics education.

## Module Overview

This module explores how VLA systems integrate multiple complex components to enable a complete pipeline from speech input to physical manipulation. The system must handle:

- Speech-to-text conversion and natural language understanding
- LLM integration for semantic comprehension and instruction parsing
- Cognitive planning and task planning algorithms
- Computer vision and sensor data processing for environment understanding
- Navigation and path planning for mobile platforms
- Manipulation and grasping control systems
- ROS 2-based communication and coordination between components

## Target Audience

This module is designed for education administrators evaluating AI adoption, with focus on system-level efficiency, learning outcomes, and applied intelligence. The content emphasizes evidence-backed reasoning and outcome-oriented analysis.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will understand:
- The fundamental components of Vision-Language-Action systems
- How LLMs integrate with robotics for cognitive planning
- The pipeline from speech input to physical manipulation
- Applications of VLA systems in educational contexts
- The integration of perception, language, planning, and execution
