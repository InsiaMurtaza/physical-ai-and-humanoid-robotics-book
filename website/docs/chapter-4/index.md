# Chapter 4: Understanding URDF for Humanoid Robots

## Introduction

This chapter covers the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) for modeling humanoid robots in ROS. You'll learn how to create, structure, and validate URDF files that represent complex robotic systems with multiple links and joints, focusing specifically on humanoid robot architectures.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the purpose and structure of URDF in ROS
- Define links, joints, and kinematic chains for humanoid robots
- Create a minimal humanoid URDF model with proper joint configurations
- Validate URDF models using ROS tools
- Understand the relationship between URDF and robot kinematics

## Table of Contents

- [Links, Joints, and Kinematic Chains](./kinematic-chains.md)
- [Building Minimal Humanoid URDF](./humanoid-models.md)
- [URDF Validation with ROS Tools](./validation.md)

This chapter provides the foundational knowledge needed to model humanoid robots for simulation and control in ROS environments.
