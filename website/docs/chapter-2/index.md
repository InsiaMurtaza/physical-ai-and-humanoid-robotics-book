# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication: Nodes, Topics, Services

This chapter covers the core communication patterns in ROS 2: nodes, topics, and services. You'll learn how to implement basic ROS 2 communication patterns and understand node lifecycle, publisher/subscriber patterns, and request-response services.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Understand the node lifecycle in ROS 2
- Implement publisher/subscriber patterns
- Create service-based request-response patterns
- Build minimal working examples of each communication pattern

## Table of Contents

- [Node Lifecycle](./nodes.md)
- [Topics: Publishers and Subscribers](./topics.md)
- [Services and Request-Response Patterns](./services.md)
- [Validation and Testing](./validation.md)

This chapter provides the practical skills needed to build ROS 2 applications. Understanding these communication patterns is essential for any ROS 2 development.
