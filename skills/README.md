# Skills Framework for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This repository contains a comprehensive skills framework designed to support the development and documentation of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics systems across three key modules:

## Modules

### Module 1: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Skills for creating, configuring, and managing digital twin simulations that mirror physical robotic systems in virtual environments.

### Module 2: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)
Skills for implementing AI-powered robot brains using NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem for perception, navigation, and decision-making.

### Module 3: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Skills for implementing multimodal systems that connect vision, language, and action for natural human-robot interaction.

## Skill Categories

Each module contains skills organized into four categories:

### 1. Research Skills
- Search, extract, and summarize information from relevant sources
- Produce structured notes and fact summaries
- Support quick reuse across different projects and chapters

### 2. Technical Explanation Skills
- Explain complex technical workflows and processes
- Convert concepts into structured explanation chains
- Generate clean, readable diagrams for robot architectures

### 3. Writing & Documentation Skills
- Create clear, comprehensive documentation
- Develop tutorials and implementation guides
- Document architecture decisions and system specifications

### 4. Implementation Skills
- Provide practical implementation procedures
- Create working code examples and configurations
- Address testing and validation procedures

## Usage

These skills are designed to be:
- Reusable across different projects and sub-agents
- Modular and independent
- Callable by any component of the system
- Focused on streamlining writing, research, and technical explanation

Each skill is defined as a markdown file containing:
- Purpose and objective
- Parameters that can be customized
- Expected output format
