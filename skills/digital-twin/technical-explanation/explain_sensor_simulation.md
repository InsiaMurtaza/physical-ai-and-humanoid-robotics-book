# Explain Sensor Simulation Skill

## Purpose
Explain how different types of sensors are simulated in digital twin environments.

## Parameters
- sensor_type: Type of sensor (camera, lidar, IMU, etc.)
- platform: Target platform (Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim)
- fidelity: Required simulation fidelity level

## Output
Sensor simulation explanation with:
- Physical modeling approach
- Noise and distortion models
- Configuration parameters
- Performance vs. accuracy trade-offs
- Integration with perception pipelines
