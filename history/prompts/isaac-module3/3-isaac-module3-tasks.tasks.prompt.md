# PHR: Isaac Module 3 Tasks

## Prompt Text

```
update the sp.tasks file for module 3. Do not modify or regenerate tasks for module 1 and 2.
```

## Response Text

Created a comprehensive tasks file for Module 3 (The AI-Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac™) that includes:

- Setup phase with creation of all 4 chapter files (Chapters 9-12)
- Foundational phase with research on Isaac ecosystem, Sim, and ROS integration
- Three user story phases aligned with priorities from the specification:
  - US1 (P1): Education Administrator evaluating Isaac module
  - US2 (P2): Academic Evaluator assessing module structure
  - US3 (P3): Curriculum Coordinator reviewing content alignment
- Quality validation phase with cross-referencing and compliance checks
- Polish phase with APA citations and final formatting

All tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. The tasks are organized to support parallel execution where possible and maintain the analytical focus required for education administrators.

## Outcome

Successfully created a complete tasks file with 57 specific, actionable tasks organized by phase and user story priority, following all format requirements and maintaining focus on analytical understanding rather than implementation details.
