# PHR: Isaac Module 3 Planning

## Prompt Text

```
Update the existing sp.plan file by appending a planning section for Module 3 only.
Do not modify or regenerate plans for Module 1 or Module 2.

Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Create the following for Module 3:
- A high-level architecture sketch covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, ROS 2 integration, and perception-to-action pipelines.
- A section execution structure aligned with the Module 3 chapters defined in sp.specify.
- A research-concurrent approach where literature review and technical validation occur alongside writing.
- A list of key technical and design decisions that require documentation, including options and tradeoffs (e.g., perception models, simulation fidelity, navigation approaches).
- A quality validation and testing strategy based on acceptance criteria for accuracy, coherence, and technical plausibility.

Organize the plan explicitly by phases:
Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis

Technical constraints:
- Follow APA citation style as defined in the Constitution
```

## Response Text

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for Module 3 (The AI-Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac™) that includes:

- High-level architecture sketch showing Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, ROS 2 integration, and perception-to-action pipelines
- Section execution structure with properly numbered chapters (9-12) continuing the sequence from Module 2
- Research-concurrent approach with literature review and technical validation
- Key technical and design decisions with options and tradeoffs for simulation fidelity, perception pipelines, navigation systems, and synthetic data generation
- Quality validation strategy based on accuracy, coherence, and technical plausibility

The plan follows the required phases: Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis and maintains alignment with APA citation requirements from the Constitution.

## Outcome

Successfully created a complete implementation plan that addresses all requirements for Module 3 planning, with proper sequential chapter numbering (9-12) continuing from Module 2, and comprehensive technical and academic validation strategies.
