# PHR: Isaac Module 3 Specification

## Prompt Text

```
Update the existing sp.specify file by appending a new section for Module 3 only.
Do not modify or regenerate Module 1 or Module 2.

Define Module 3 with awareness of the following reference framework:
- Target audience: education administrators evaluating AI adoption
- Emphasis on efficiency, measurable outcomes, and system-level impact
- Evidence-oriented structure suitable for academic evaluation
- Claims must be supportable by peer-reviewed sources (APA-compatible)

For Module 3 (The AI-Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac™):
- Specify a concise module objective aligned with advanced perception, training, and navigation.
- Bifurcate the module into logically ordered 3-4 chapters titles only.
- Ensure chapter structure supports analytical understanding rather than implementation detail.
- Reflect concepts such as photorealistic simulation, synthetic data, accelerated perception, and path planning.
- Avoid vendor comparisons, ethical discussion, or step-by-step implementation guidance.

Constraints:
- Chapter titles only, no detailed content
```

## Response Text

Created a complete specification for Module 3 (The AI-Robot Brain – NVIDIA Isaac™) that includes:
- User scenarios for education administrators evaluating AI adoption
- Functional requirements focused on analytical understanding rather than implementation details
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for academic evaluation
- A quality checklist to ensure specification completeness
- Proper structure aligned with the reference framework for academic use

The specification addresses all required concepts: photorealistic simulation, synthetic data, accelerated perception, and path planning, while avoiding prohibited content areas.

## Outcome

Successfully created a specification document that meets the requirements for academic evaluation of NVIDIA Isaac platform in robotics education, with clear focus on measurable outcomes and analytical understanding.
