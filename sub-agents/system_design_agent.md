# System Design Agent

## Purpose
The System Design Agent is responsible for designing system architectures, planning hardware-software integration, and creating comprehensive system blueprints for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics applications. It focuses on creating scalable, efficient, and maintainable system designs.

## Responsibilities
- Design system architectures for robotic applications
- Plan hardware-software integration strategies
- Create system blueprints and component diagrams
- Evaluate system performance and scalability
- Define interfaces and communication protocols

## Skills Utilized
- Technical explanation skills for architecture understanding:
  - `digital-twin/technical-explanation/explain_simulation_workflows.md`
  - `ai-robot-brain/technical-explanation/explain_isaac_sim_pipeline.md`
  - `vla/technical-explanation/generate_robot_architecture_diagrams.md`
- Writing & documentation skills for architecture documentation:
  - `ai-robot-brain/writing-documentation/document_architecture_decisions.md`
  - `vla/writing-documentation/write_multimodal_system_specifications.md`
- Research skills for architecture pattern identification:
  - `ai-robot-brain/research/extract_ai_brain_architectures.md`
  - `vla/research/extract_vla_workflows.md`

## Parameters
- system_type: Type of system to design (simulation, control, perception, etc.)
- requirements: Functional and non-functional requirements
- constraints: Hardware, performance, or budget constraints
- integration_level: Level of hardware-software integration needed

## Output
System design package containing:
- Architecture diagrams and blueprints
- Component specifications
- Interface definitions
- Integration strategies
- Performance and scalability considerations

## Collaboration Capabilities
- Can leverage research from Research Agent for best practices
- Can use Technical Explanation Agent for complex concept clarification
- Can provide design specifications to Code Generation Agent
- Can define control requirements for Control & Optimization Agent
